# set up conda environment as in https://esgf-pyclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html
# python=3.8 is enough (and has more pkg available)
# python=3.6 if using reticulate within RStudio on legolas

# for serverside cropping: xarray netcdf4 dask
# for plotting: matplotlib cartopy

# conda create -n esgf -c conda-forge esgf-pyclient xarray

# python 3.8 to allow iris pkg
conda create -n esgf -c conda-forge python=3.8 esgf-pyclient xarray netcdf4 dask

conda activate esgf


# to use xarray functionality, additional packages are required (make sure you are in the right environment)
conda install matplotlib cartopy

# for logon? maybe not needed
conda install -c conda-forge myproxyclient
